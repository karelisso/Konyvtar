    In this example, the table is wrapped in a div element with the class table-responsive, which ensures that the table is horizontally scrollable on smaller screens. The table itself has the classes table and table-striped, which add styling to the table.

    By default, Bootstrap tables are responsive and will stack vertically on smaller screens. You can further customize the appearance of the table on mobile devices by adding additional classes, such as table-sm to reduce the padding between rows and columns or table-bordered to add borders around each cell.
